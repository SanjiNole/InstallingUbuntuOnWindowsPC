In this project, I am explaining and showing how I installed Ubuntu on my PC via flash drive from a Windows computer, a process that involves several key steps: first, downloading the Ubuntu ISO file from the official Ubuntu website; second, using a tool like Rufus or BalenaEtcher to create a bootable USB drive from the downloaded ISO; third, configuring the PC's BIOS settings to boot from the USB drive; fourth, booting the PC from the USB drive and selecting the 'Install Ubuntu' option; fifth, following the on-screen installation wizard to partition the hard drive, set up user accounts, and complete the installation; and finally, removing the USB drive and restarting the computer to boot into the newly installed Ubuntu operating system. Ihave photos that guide through it all
